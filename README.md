**CONVEX HULL-**
    The convex hull of a set of points is a key concept in computational geometry. It refers to the smallest convex polygon that can completely enclose a given set of points in a plane.
    In this assignment we have used Jarvis's March Algorithm implemented in C++ Language:

    Process:
        Find the Leftmost Point: Start with the leftmost point, which is guaranteed to be part of the convex hull.
        Wrap Around: Move counterclockwise from this point to find the next point on the hull. Repeat until you return to the starting point.
    Complexity:
        O(nh) where h is the number of vertices in the convex hull,n is the number of points in the input set.

**Information About Files:**

  This project is organized into multiple directories and files to efficiently manage the source code, declarations, tests, and build process.
 
    File Structure:

    app/: Contains the main application file.
        app.cpp: The entry point of the application where the main execution starts.

    include/: Holds all the header files with function and class declarations.
        geometry.hpp: Header file containing the declarations related to geometric operations and functions.
        gnuplot-iostream.h: Header file for Gnuplot integration, used for plotting and visualizations.

    src/: Contains the implementation of the functions declared in the header files.
        geometry.cpp: Source file where the geometry-related functions and classes are defined.

    test/: Contains the unit tests for verifying the functionality of the library.
        test.cpp: File containing test cases for the functions defined in geometry.cpp.

    lib/: Stores the compiled libraries generated by the Makefile.
        *.so files: Shared library files created during the build process.

    obj/: Holds object files generated during the compilation.
        *.o files: Object files created from the source files.
    
    bin/: Contains the executable files generated during the build process.
        app.out: Executable file generated from the app.cpp file.
        test.out: Executable file generated from the test.cpp file.

    Makefile: Automates the build process, including compiling the source code, creating object files, and linking them to form the final executable or libraries.

    README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, including the structure and instructions on how to build and run the application.

**COMPILATION AND RUNNING STEP:**

    * Compilation:

        The project uses a Makefile to streamline the build process. To compile the project, follow these steps:

        Navigate to the Project Directory:
        Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project where the Makefile is located.

    * Compile the Project:
        Run the "make" command to compile the source files and generate the necessary object files, libraries and executables.

    * Clean the Build:
        To remove all generated files (object files, libraries, and executables) and start fresh, use: "make clean" Command in Terminal

        This will delete all files in the obj/, lib/, and bin/ directories, allowing for a fresh build.
    
    * Running the Application:

        After compiling, you can run the main application using: "make run"
    
        This command executes the main application file located in the bin/ directory.

    * Running the Test File:

        After compiling, you can run the Test File using: "make test"
    
        This command executes the Test file for unit testing.

**Additional Information:**

    * Dependencies: Ensure all required libraries (like Gnuplot and boost_iostreams) are installed on your system.

    * Makefile Targets:
        make all: Compiles the project.
        make lib: Creates a shared library from the source files.
        make app: Compiles the main application.
        make test: Compiles the test cases.
        make clean: Cleans up all compiled files.
        make run: Executes the main application.
        make run_test: Executes the test cases.


    *Dependencies

        Ensure all required libraries are installed on your system:

            Gnuplot
            Boost Iostreams

        Gnuplot:

           $ sudo apt update
           $ sudo apt install gnuplot

        Boost Iostreams:

            $ sudo apt update
            $ sudo apt install libboost-iostreams-dev
